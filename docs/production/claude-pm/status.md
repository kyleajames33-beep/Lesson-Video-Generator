## Done

- Shared explainer engine `src/explainer/` (Sonnet port of the mould kit), with `scripts/build-explainer-preview.mjs`, `scripts/explainer-stills.mjs` and `scripts/render-explainer.mjs --confirm` (slim public folder, chunked, cleans up). Mould runs on it; hook card overlap and bread alpha haze fixed; paper grain is a static tile for smooth live preview.

- Mould experiment rendered: `out/experiments/mould-claude/mould-claude-v1.mp4` (owner preferred it to the Codex build).

## Codex hand-ins

### Brief 03: C1 and B1 fact checks (11 October 2026)

Created `docs/production/claude-pm/checks/c1-check.md` and `docs/production/claude-pm/checks/b1-check.md`. Checked the draft narration, Visual notes and key notes against each site's extract and science references. C1 has 2 science findings. B1 has 2 science findings and 1 finding about terms used before teaching their meanings. No copy problems found. Screen checks skipped as requested because there are no stills yet. Questions for Claude: none.

### Brief 01: wave 1 artwork (11 October 2026)

Created with the built-in imagegen tool:

- `public/assets/chemistry/c1-sparkling-bottle-sealed-v1.png`
- `public/assets/chemistry/c1-sparkling-bottle-open-v1.png`
- `public/assets/chemistry/c1-book-on-table-v1.png`
- `public/assets/biology/b1-prize-strawberry-plant-v1.png`
- `public/assets/biology/b1-varied-seedlings-v1.png`
- `public/assets/biology/b1-clone-row-disease-v1.png`
- `public/assets/biology/b1-dry-soil-trays-v1.png`
- `docs/production/claude-pm/assets/wave1-provenance.json`

Opened both style references and all seven final PNGs. Checked subjects, plant counts, varied seedlings, matching diseased plants, no text or labels, clean alpha edges on light and dark backgrounds, at least 1600 pixels on the long side and at least 8% empty margins. One retake per asset. Cleared invisible background residue and added transparent canvas space where needed, without resampling. All seven SHA256 hashes match the provenance.

The bottle images share the same canvas, position, scale and water height. Their contours have small redraw differences of 1 to 7 pixels at sampled body edges; Claude should check the crossfade at its display size. No other unfinished work. Questions for Claude: none.


- 11 October 2026, Brief 02 complete. Created `docs/production/claude-pm/site-extracts/chem-m5-l01.md`, `docs/production/claude-pm/site-extracts/chem-m5-l02.md`, `docs/production/claude-pm/site-extracts/chem-m5-l03.md`, `docs/production/claude-pm/site-extracts/chem-m5-l04.md`, `docs/production/claude-pm/site-extracts/bio-m5-l01.md`, `docs/production/claude-pm/site-extracts/bio-m5-l02.md`, `docs/production/claude-pm/site-extracts/bio-m5-l03.md` and `docs/production/claude-pm/site-extracts/bio-m5-l04.md`. Read all eight lesson bodies and compared the four named voiceover scripts. Independent review found no remaining errors after corrections. Each extract has the nine requested headings, at most 600 words and no em dashes. Nothing could not be completed. Questions for Claude: none.
- 11 October 2026, Brief 04 complete. Created:
  - `public/assets/chemistry/c1-campfire-burning-v1.png`
  - `public/assets/chemistry/c1-campfire-ash-v1.png`
  - `public/assets/chemistry/c1-sealed-flask-iodine-v1.png`
  - `public/assets/chemistry/c1-evaporating-beaker-v1.png`
  - `public/assets/chemistry/c1-salt-jar-crystals-v1.png`
  - `public/assets/chemistry/c1-hot-coffee-v1.png`
  - `public/assets/chemistry/c1-burned-magnesium-v1.png`
  - `public/assets/biology/b1-cavendish-bunch-v1.png`
  - `public/assets/biology/b1-banana-plantation-tr4-v1.png`
  - `public/assets/biology/b1-stable-pond-v1.png`
  - `public/assets/biology/b1-lone-island-plant-v1.png`
  - `public/assets/biology/b1-diseased-crop-field-v1.png`
  - `docs/production/claude-pm/assets/wave1b-provenance.json`

All twelve PNGs inspected on checkerboard: transparent alpha, no text, clean edges, matching subjects, at least 1600 px long side and at least 8% empty margins. Generated with built-in imagegen. Burning campfire retaken once, ash twice, flask once for even violet colour. The campfire pair has the same canvas and position; original visible foreground and side stones preserved in the ash image. Independent native overlay found no remaining visible errors after a mask-seam repair. Prompts, tools, hashes, retakes and adjustments are recorded in the provenance. Nothing unfinished. Questions for Claude: none.

### Brief 03: mould fact and screen check (11 October 2026)

Created `docs/production/claude-pm/checks/mould-check.md`. Checked all nine narration fields, on-screen text and all 21 stills against the fungi extract and reproduction definitions. Found one screen problem: the germination scene's "branches" label and leader are clipped by the image panel. No science, syllabus or copy errors found after excluding the known phrase as requested. Nothing could not be completed. Questions for Claude: none.

### Brief 05: B1 binary fission and budding artwork (11 October 2026)

Created:

- `public/assets/biology/b1-fission-1-v1.png`
- `public/assets/biology/b1-fission-2-v1.png`
- `public/assets/biology/b1-fission-3-v1.png`
- `public/assets/biology/b1-budding-1-v1.png`
- `public/assets/biology/b1-budding-2-v1.png`
- `public/assets/biology/b1-budding-3-v1.png`
- `docs/production/claude-pm/assets/b1-fission-budding-provenance.json`
- Checkerboard, light, dark and overlay views in `docs/production/claude-pm/assets/b1-fission-budding-qa/`.

Generated with built-in imagegen after opening both botanical references. All six final PNGs checked on checkerboard and light and dark backgrounds: real alpha transparency, no text or halo, correct subjects, 1800 x 1200 canvases and at least 8% empty margins. Both sets checked on overlays. The yeast parent stays fixed outside the changing attachment site; its lower body is pixel-identical in all three frames. Fission stages 2 and 3 share outer endpoints and cell height; stage 3 repeats one daughter drawing so both daughters are identical. First fission frame retaken once for haze; final budding frame retaken once for daughter size. Transparency cleanup, alignment and parent reuse are recorded with exact prompts and SHA256 hashes in the provenance. Nothing unfinished. Questions for Claude: none.

### Brief 07: Module 5 coverage ledger (11 October 2026)

Created `docs/production/claude-pm/coverage-ledger.md`. Tracks only the 2017 Year 12 Module 5 syllabus: 19 Chemistry rows and 26 Biology rows, including required child points, plus 23 Chemistry and 29 Biology video records in route order. Applied the teaching ownership reset and checked the finished C1, B1 and mould designs. Every required content point has a planned home; practical work and learner modelling remain open. Planned memory aids and numerical examples are marked pending. Checked route membership, local links, table columns and no em dashes.

C1 and B1 remain in production because their complete MP4s are not present yet; mould is rendered. No Brief 06 upload record exists, so none is marked released. This is the only unfinished state update. Questions for Claude: none.


### Brief 08: Module 5 lessons 5 to 8 site extracts (11 October 2026)

Created:

- `docs/production/claude-pm/site-extracts/chem-m5-l05.md`
- `docs/production/claude-pm/site-extracts/chem-m5-l06.md`
- `docs/production/claude-pm/site-extracts/chem-m5-l07.md`
- `docs/production/claude-pm/site-extracts/chem-m5-l08.md`
- `docs/production/claude-pm/site-extracts/bio-m5-l05.md`
- `docs/production/claude-pm/site-extracts/bio-m5-l06.md`
- `docs/production/claude-pm/site-extracts/bio-m5-l07.md`
- `docs/production/claude-pm/site-extracts/bio-m5-l08.md`

Read all eight full lesson pages and their coherence signoffs. Quoted the 2017 syllabus points. Compared Chemistry L05/L06 with the current C3, pressure and catalyst voiceover scripts; no current topic-matching script found for Chemistry L07/L08 or Biology L05-L08. Independent review found no remaining errors after corrections. All files have the nine requested headings, 526 to 600 words and no em dashes. Nothing could not be completed. Questions for Claude: none.

### Brief 09: C2 and B2a fact checks and artwork (11 October 2026)

Checked the current revision 3 designs, which supersede the revision 2 named in the prompt. Created `docs/production/claude-pm/checks/c2-check.md` (1 science finding) and `docs/production/claude-pm/checks/b2a-check.md` (6 science findings). No syllabus or copy findings. Screen checks skipped because there are no stills. The C2 rate arithmetic and products-only start agree after rounding; the real all-gas flask conditions need correction. B2a findings cover coral spawning, fish fertilisation, recovery arithmetic, bearded dragon clutch size and seal care.

Created:

- `public/assets/chemistry/c2-flask-start-v1.png`
- `public/assets/chemistry/c2-flask-equilibrium-v1.png`
- `public/assets/biology/common-frog-pond-b2-v1-alpha.png`
- `public/assets/biology/hen-reproductive-location-b2-v1-alpha.png`
- `public/assets/biology/hen-nest-b2-v1-alpha.png`
- `public/assets/biology/b2-coral-spawning-v1.png`
- `public/assets/biology/b2-coral-spawn-cloud-v1.png`
- `public/assets/biology/b2-salmon-spawning-v1.png`
- `public/assets/biology/b2-seal-and-pup-v1.png`
- `public/assets/biology/b2-desert-lizard-v1.png`
- `public/assets/biology/b2-sea-turtle-nest-v1.png`
- `public/assets/biology/b2-oyster-bed-v1.png`
- `public/assets/biology/b2-dugong-and-calf-v1.png`
- `docs/production/claude-pm/assets/c2-provenance.json`
- `docs/production/claude-pm/assets/b2-provenance.json`
- Checkerboard, light/dark and overlay checks, processing scripts and records in `docs/production/claude-pm/assets/c2-qa/`, `b2-cutout-qa/` and `b2-new-qa/`.

Generated new plates with built-in imagegen after opening both botanical references and the existing frog and hen plates. Opened final checkerboard views and inspected anatomy. All 13 PNGs have real alpha, no text or surrounding halo, at least 1600 px on the long side and at least 8% margins. All final hashes match provenance. Flask hardware and alpha are pixel-identical; only the gas cavity changes. Coral/cloud layers share the same canvas and translation, checked together. Cut-outs preserve the original RGB pixels, with only alpha and transparent padding added. New images were not resampled. The lizard shows six visible eggs at the front of a partly hidden larger clutch, following the science finding. Coral releases bundles; breakup belongs in the animation. Oyster retaken once to narrow the shell openings; start flask retaken once to remove liquid-like shading. Optional lizard internal cut-away skipped as allowed; use the coded overlay. The Brief 09 provenance names take precedence over the older wave1b name in the C2 design, so wave1b-provenance.json was not changed.

Could not fully verify intact PCl5 vapour colour, Chinook's exact 4,000 lower egg-count limit, or millions of eggs for every cod female. Sources and limits are recorded in the checks. All requested required artwork completed. Question for Claude: resolve the science findings and these three verification gaps before recording. No narration, lesson source, scene code or design files changed; no speech, renders, commits or pushes.


### Brief 06: public YouTube uploads, wave 1 (11 October 2026)

Created `docs/production/claude-pm/youtube/wave1-uploads.json` with file SHA256 hashes, exact metadata, caption paths, frame thumbnails, playlist positions and upload dates. Published all three approved MP4s to HSCScience:

- Chemistry C1: https://youtu.be/zaC5iXuovKg
- Biology B1: https://youtu.be/44FFfv7RGck
- Biology bread mould: https://youtu.be/w7edKqGAUwA

All are Public, not made for kids, Education, English (Australia), with timed English (Australia) captions published and clear frames from the videos as thumbnails. Created the missing public Year 12 Module 5 playlists with 2017 syllabus labels. Public playlist pages confirm Chemistry C1 at position 1 and Biology B1 before mould at positions 1 and 2. Both playlists use manual sorting so intervening lessons can be inserted later. No duplicate upload, video edit, render or speech generation.

The official course URLs are in the descriptions, but Studio says external links need the channel's one-off verification before they become clickable. Account verification is outside this brief. Nothing else unfinished. Questions for Claude: none.

### Brief 13: B2b artwork follow-up (12 October 2026)

Created `public/assets/biology/b2b-paintbrush-pollination-v1.png`. Corrected `public/assets/biology/b2b-pollen-grain-closeup-v1.png` to leave a plain interior for animated cells and `public/assets/biology/b2b-bagged-flower-v1.png` to remove the left flower's anthers, matching the current attempt. Earlier PNGs are preserved in `docs/production/claude-pm/assets/b2b-qa/`. Kept the bean seed, bean seedling and nine other matching plates unchanged.

Created `docs/production/claude-pm/assets/b2b-provenance.json` with exact prompts, tools, retakes and matching hashes for all 14 PNGs. Checks and final light/dark/checkerboard views are in `docs/production/claude-pm/assets/b2b-qa/followup-*`; `followup-review.md` records the result. All 14 pass alpha, size and margin checks. Pea pair alpha and outer pixels match exactly. No text or exterior halo visible.

No pollen-tube overlay delivered because exact generated alignment is not assured; use the coded path allowed by asset brief item 5. The existing bee's far legs remain hidden, so six separately countable legs could not be verified. Question for Claude: none. No narration, lesson source, scene code, speech, renders, commits or pushes.

### Brief 11: public YouTube uploads, wave 2 (12 October 2026)

Created `docs/production/claude-pm/youtube/wave2-uploads.json` with exact metadata, MP4 SHA256 hashes, captions, frame thumbnails, playlist positions and upload dates. Published both approved files at the requested paths:

- Chemistry C2: https://youtu.be/vd9Ory9-flE
- Biology B2a: https://youtu.be/0P33z4D2q0E

Both are Public, not made for kids, Education and English (Australia), with timed English (Australia) SRT captions published and AI use disclosed. HD processing completed with no copyright issues. Inspected the video frames and retained Chemistry frame 2; chose Biology frame 1. Public playlists confirm C1 then C2 at positions 1 and 2, and B1, B2a, bread mould at positions 1, 2 and 3. No duplicate playlists or videos were created. Browser control timed out during Biology upload; resumed its saved draft and completed it without uploading again. No video edits, renders, speech, commits or pushes.

Studio still says external description links need one-off channel verification before they become clickable. The official 2017 course URLs are present as text; account verification is outside this brief. Nothing else unfinished. Questions for Claude: none.

### Brief 14: C3 and B2c checks and artwork (12 October 2026)

Checked revision 4 of both designs before generating artwork. Created `docs/production/claude-pm/checks/c3-check.md` (2 findings: label rounded rates and add fixed-size container to the gas aid) and `docs/production/claude-pm/checks/b2c-check.md` (3 findings: Acineta internal brood pouch, its lorica, and the explanation of answer 6). Official NSW 2017 syllabuses checked. No syllabus or copy errors found. Screen checks skipped because there are no stills.

Created with built-in imagegen:

- `public/assets/chemistry/c3-iron-tube-start-v1.png`
- `public/assets/chemistry/c3-iron-tube-deep-v1.png`
- `public/assets/chemistry/c3-cobalt-tube-pink-v1.png`
- `public/assets/chemistry/c3-cobalt-tube-purple-v1.png`
- `public/assets/chemistry/c3-cobalt-tube-blue-v1.png`
- `public/assets/biology/b2c-amoeba-fission-1-v1.png`
- `public/assets/biology/b2c-amoeba-fission-2-v1.png`
- `public/assets/biology/b2c-amoeba-fission-3-v1.png`
- `public/assets/biology/b2c-paramecium-v1.png`
- `public/assets/biology/b2c-acineta-bud-v1.png`
- `public/assets/biology/b2c-milk-glass-bench-v1.png`
- `docs/production/claude-pm/assets/c3-provenance.json`
- `docs/production/claude-pm/assets/b2c-provenance.json`
- Prompts, raw paths, checkerboards, processing scripts and checks in `docs/production/claude-pm/assets/c3-qa/` and `docs/production/claude-pm/assets/b2c-qa/`.

All 11 PNGs have real alpha, no text or visible halo, and at least 1600 pixels on the long side. Opened every checkerboard and checked final hashes. Chemistry sets retain identical hardware and alpha; only liquid pixels change. Independent review requested a paler iron start, retaken and rechecked. Amoeba nuclei align within 0.5 pixel after one registration resample of plate 3; other Biology plates were padded without resampling. Acineta follows the science findings: lorica and internal ciliated bud in a cutaway. The animator must conceal the original painted bud when its cutout leaves. Dedicated C3 provenance follows Brief 14 rather than the older wave1b path in the design.

Nothing unfinished in this brief. Question for Claude: resolve the five science findings before recording, and account for the Acineta bud concealment when animating. No narration, designs, lesson source or scene code changed. No speech, video renders, commits or pushes.

### Brief 17: Module 5 coverage ledger update (12 October 2026)

Updated `docs/production/claude-pm/coverage-ledger.md`. Read all ten new designs and updated both subject tables: terms with plain meanings, memory aids, worked examples and numbers, and earlier ideas recalled. Kept all 19 Chemistry and 26 Biology 2017 content rows. There are now 23 Chemistry and 28 Biology video records: B2b flowering plants, B2c single-celled organisms, separate mould and planned runner, and B3a parts 1 and 2. B3b still owns agriculture. Updated C1/B1/mould to released from `youtube/wave1-uploads.json`, C2/B2a to rendered, and the other new designs to in production. No route file or lesson design changed.

Finding: B2b scene 8 re-teaches B1's conditions/variation comparison (B1 scenes 5, 7 item 3 and 8): stable conditions favour clones, shared alleles give shared disease weakness, and varied seedlings may survive change. B2b attempt 10 item 3 tests that comparison again with potatoes. This is a full explanation scene rather than a short recall. No other new design repeats an earlier owned explanation beyond recall or applying it to its new mechanism.

No required 2017 Module 5 content point has no home. The separate runner growth mechanism remains planned; B2b only recalls the runner. Practical investigations and learner modelling remain open. C3, C4a, C4b, B2c and both B3a parts still list fact checks as pending; those gates are recorded, not marked passed. Route naming and pending uploads are also flagged for Claude.

Checked unchanged syllabus rows, all ten design records, route order around the B3a split, unique table rows, column counts, local links and no em dashes. No files created. Nothing in Brief 17 could not be completed. Question for Claude: should B2b scene 8 be shortened to a recall of B1?

### Brief 19: Chemistry C5 to C8 checks and assets (13 October 2026)

Created `docs/production/claude-pm/checks/c5-check.md`, `c6-check.md`, `c7-check.md`, `c8-check.md` and `docs/production/claude-pm/assets/c5-c8-provenance.json`. Checked C5 Revision 4, C6 Revision 3, C7 Revision 4 and C8 Revision 4, with exact source hashes. Recomputed the numbers and compared the designs with the site extracts, corrections and NSW 2017 syllabus. C5 has two science findings: its universal K-size bands do not prove almost complete conversion, and the K = 4 attempt needs starting proportions to support its answer. C6, C7 and C8 have no findings. No stills or audio were checked.

All four artwork items are optional and explicitly allow coded fallbacks. Skipped them under Brief 19 and recorded each decision, plus the requested owner site notes, in the provenance file. No mandatory artwork remained. The l09 extract already exists and was read. Checked report hashes, valid provenance JSON and no em dashes in the new files. No narration, lesson designs, scene code, speech, renders, commits or pushes.

Nothing could not be completed within Brief 19. Question for Claude: will you replace the universal composition bands and give the invented K = 4 attempt equal starting reactant concentrations with no products before recording C5?
